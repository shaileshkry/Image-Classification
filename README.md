Image Classification for Malaria Cell Detection
Overview
This project aims to detect malaria-infected cells using image classification techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains images of healthy and infected cells. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for training and classification. We implement the model using TensorFlow and Keras.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Malaria Cell Dataset. It consists of images of both infected and uninfected cells, which are classified into the appropriate categories using a deep learning model.

Healthy Cells: These are images of cells that are not infected by malaria.
Infected Cells: These images show cells that are infected by malaria.
Source:
The dataset can be found on Kaggle here.

Methodology
Preprocessing:
The images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve the robustness of the model.
Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and zooming are applied to enhance the dataset.
Model Architecture:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify the cell images.
The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers.
Dropout is used to prevent overfitting.
Activation functions such as ReLU and softmax are utilized.
Training:
The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras with the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
The dataset is split into training and validation sets, and the model is evaluated on unseen test data to assess performance.
Evaluation:
The model's performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Confusion matrices are generated to analyze classification results.
